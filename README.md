**usiness Problem**

    Marketing teams often overspend on channels that drive clicks — not long-term value.
    Traditional reporting focuses on CPC/CPA, ignoring lifetime value and profitability.

This leads to problems like:

    High spend on paid ads with poor lifetime value.
    Budget decisions based on vanity metrics instead of business impact.
    No insight into how reallocating budget would affect ROI and CLTV.
   
**Solution — What This Dashboard Does**

    Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
    Conversion Rate
    Revenue by Channel
    Return on Investment (ROI)
    Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
